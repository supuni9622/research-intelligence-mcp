# Connecting MCP Clients

Step-by-step instructions for connecting a client to Research Intelligence
MCP. Covers the two supported connection paths:

| Path | Transport | Clients | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `stdio` | Claude Desktop, Cursor, MCP Inspector | none |
| B | `streamable-http` | ResearchMind, custom Python clients, MCP Inspector | optional bearer JWT |

`stdio` is the default and requires nothing beyond `uv sync`. Nothing in
Path B is needed for local, single-user use.

---

## Prerequisites (all paths)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd research-intelligence-mcp
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

Confirm the entry point runs:

```bash
uv run research-intelligence-mcp
```

This blocks, waiting for MCP messages on stdin — that's expected for
`stdio`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. If it exits immediately with an error,
resolve that before configuring any client.

## A.1 — Claude Desktop

**Config file location:**

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Steps:**

1. Get the repository's absolute path: `pwd`
2. Open the config file above (create it if it doesn't exist) and add:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "research-intelligence": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/research-intelligence-mcp",
           "run",
           "research-intelligence-mcp"
         ],
         "env": {
           "APP_ENVIRONMENT": "development",
           "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/research-intelligence-mcp` with the real path.
   To supply a Semantic Scholar API key, add
   `"SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"` to `env` — never commit a
   config file containing a real key.

3. Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop (not just close the window).
4. Open the tools/integrations panel and confirm `research-intelligence` is
   connected with 7 tools listed.

**Try it:**

```text
Search Semantic Scholar and arXiv for recent papers about agentic RAG.
```

**Troubleshooting:**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `uv: command not found` | Use the absolute path from `which uv` as `"command"`. |
| Connects, but no tools appear | Check `--directory` is the absolute repo path and `uv sync` succeeded there. |
| Connects then immediately disconnects | Check Claude Desktop's MCP log and the server's stderr — nothing should be written to stdout except MCP protocol frames. |

---

## A.2 — Cursor

**Config file:** `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project (or Cursor's global MCP
settings, if you prefer a machine-wide config).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "research-intelligence": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/research-intelligence-mcp",
        "run",
        "research-intelligence-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APP_ENVIRONMENT": "development",
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Restart Cursor.
2. Open Cursor's MCP settings and confirm `research-intelligence` shows as connected.
3. Ask Cursor: `Use the research-intelligence MCP tools to find papers about hybrid retrieval.`

Troubleshooting mirrors Claude Desktop above (absolute paths, `uv sync`, stderr-only logging).

---

## A.3 — MCP Inspector

The official interactive tool for discovering, invoking, and debugging MCP
tools — works with both `stdio` and `streamable-http`.

**stdio, one-shot:**

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  uv --directory "$(pwd)" run research-intelligence-mcp
```

**stdio, manual config:** start `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` with
no arguments, then in the UI set:

- Command: `uv`
- Arguments: `--directory /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/research-intelligence-mcp run research-intelligence-mcp`

**streamable-http:** start the server separately (see Path B below), then
in the Inspector UI choose the "Streamable HTTP" transport and set the URL
to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`. Add an `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
header if `AUTH_ENABLED=true`.

**Validation steps (either transport):**

1. Open the Inspector URL shown in the terminal and connect.
2. Open **Tools** — confirm all 7 tools are listed (`health_check`,
   `search_papers`, `get_paper`, `get_paper_citations`,
   `get_paper_references`, `get_related_papers`, `resolve_paper_access`).
3. Run `health_check` with `{}` — expect a structured `status: "healthy"` result.
4. Run `search_papers` with:

   ```json
   { "query": "retrieval augmented generation", "limit": 5 }
   ```

5. Try an out-of-range `limit` and confirm a structured validation error (not an unhandled exception).

## B — streamable-http (ResearchMind / custom clients)

Use this path for a remote/service-to-service client — the primary case is
the ResearchMind backend, but any client speaking MCP over HTTP works the
same way.

### B.1 — Start the server

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
MCP_PORT=8000 \
uv run python -m research_intelligence_mcp
```

Or run the container (see `docs/research_intelligence_mcp_deployment_guide.md`):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env research-intelligence-mcp:local
```

Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` (or `http://research-intelligence-mcp:8000/mcp`
via ECS Service Connect once deployed).

### B.2 — Without authentication (`AUTH_ENABLED=false`, local/dev only)

```python
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamable_http_client
import httpx

async def main() -> None:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as http_client:
        async with streamable_http_client(
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp", http_client=http_client
        ) as (read, write, _):
            async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
                await session.initialize()
                tools = await session.list_tools()
                print([t.name for t in tools.tools])
                result = await session.call_tool(
                    "search_papers",
                    {"query": "retrieval augmented generation", "limit": 2},
                )
                print(result.structuredContent)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### B.3 — With authentication (`AUTH_ENABLED=true`, production shape)

1. Configure the server per `docs/research_intelligence_mcp_authentication.md`
   (RS256 + `AUTH_JWKS_URL` in production; HS256 + `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` for
   local testing only).
2. Obtain a bearer token from your issuer (or, for local testing, mint one
   with `scripts/generate_dev_token.py` — see
   `docs/research_intelligence_mcp_authentication_testing.md` for the full
   walkthrough, including failure-path testing).
3. Pass it as an `Authorization` header on the `httpx.AsyncClient`:

   ```python
   headers = {
       "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
       "X-Request-ID": "req-example-1",
       "X-Correlation-ID": "corr-example-1",
   }

   async with httpx.AsyncClient(headers=headers) as http_client:
       async with streamable_http_client(
           "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp", http_client=http_client
       ) as (read, write, _):
           ...
   ```

`X-Request-ID` / `X-Correlation-ID` are optional but recommended — they are
bound to every structured log line the server emits for that tool call
(they are not currently echoed back as response headers; see the roadmap's
Phase 7B "Known limitations").

**Never** forward an end-user's own access token as this service
credential — mint a dedicated service-to-service token instead (see the
authentication architecture doc).

### B.4 — Health, readiness, and metrics (no MCP client needed)

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health    # liveness — always unauthenticated
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/ready     # readiness — 503 once shutting down
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics   # Prometheus text format — keep private
```

### B.5 — Automated smoke test

```bash
uv run python deployment/scripts/smoke_test.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 [--auth-token "$TOKEN"]
```

Runs every check above plus MCP session init, tool discovery, and a
`health_check` + `search_papers` call — see
`docs/research_intelligence_mcp_deployment_guide.md` §6.

## Troubleshooting (streamable-http)

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing/expired/malformed token, or `iss`/`aud` don't exactly match `AUTH_ISSUER`/`AUTH_AUDIENCE` (no trailing-slash normalization is applied). |
| `403` with `insufficient_scope` | Token's `scope` claim doesn't include everything in `AUTH_REQUIRED_SCOPES`. |
| Connection refused | Confirm `MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http` (not `stdio`) and that `MCP_HOST`/`MCP_PORT` match what the client is targeting. |
| `/health` works but `/mcp` hangs | Confirm the client sends `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` (required by the streamable-http protocol) — the official `mcp` client library does this automatically. |
| Works locally but not from another container/task | Check security groups: MCP's inbound rule must allow the caller's security group on port 8000 (see `deployment/ecs/README.md`). |
